# Using a phase space of environmental variables to drive an ensemble of cloud-resolving simulations of low marine clouds

### Author: Ehsan Erfani

This is a work in progress and codes will be added and updated.

### Descriptions:
Codes are developed to encompass the broad range of conditions present in low marine cloud regions, by building a library of observed environmental conditions. This approach can be used, for example, to more systematically test the fidelity of Large Eddy Simulations (LES) in representing these clouds. A few locations in the stratocumulus (Sc) deck region of the Northeast Pacific during summer are selected to fill out a phase space of cloud controlling variables (CCVs). Thereafter, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce the dimensionality and to select a reduced set of components that explain most of the variability among CCVs in order to efficiently select cases for LES simulations that encompass the observed CCV phase space. From this phase space, 75-100 cases with distinct environmental conditions will be selected and used to initialize 2-day LES modeling to provide a spectrum of aerosol-cloud interactions and Sc-to-Cumulus transition under observed ambient conditions.

### Requirements:
- Python3 in Jupyter Notebook (installed by Anaconda).
- See the beginning of each code for the required Python3 libraries.
